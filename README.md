# decent-movies
Introducing Decentralized Movies! An (obviously) decentralized movie movie platform built with Flutter for the frontend, and Node.JS on the backend with upcoming script support.

## The Planned Features
* Add plugins to the backend through the frontend
* Connect to the backend and optionally enter a password (public backends have the plugin feature disabled on the frontend)
* Stream movies through backend plugins (plugins not provided)
* Dual-watch movies with websockets
* Very simple UI, just a search bar that indexes titles and a settings button
* Available on all platforms
* Subtitle support with plugin (provided)
